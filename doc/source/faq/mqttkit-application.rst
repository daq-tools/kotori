Application configuration
#########################


************
Introduction
************
The core of each data acquisition application is its configuration object.


*************
Configuration
*************
This configuration snippet will create an
application object defined as ``[amazonas]``.

::

    ; -----------------------------
    ; Data acquisition through MQTT
    ; -----------------------------
    [amazonas]
    enable      = true
    type        = application
    realm       = amazonas
    mqtt_topics = amazonas/#
    application = kotori.daq.application.mqttkit:mqttkit_application


***********
Description
***********
This essentially spawns an application on the realm ``amazonas``.

- The realm -- here called ``amazonas`` -- designates the "tenant"
  or "vendor" by means of a multi-tenant system.
- Kotori will subscribe to the MQTT topic ``amazonas/#``
  to receive all readings published to that topic.
- When data is received, the data payload will be evaluated
  through the machinery defined through the software component
  ``kotori.daq.application.mqttkit``.
  This component is assembled from several baseline
  software components from the toolbox of Kotori.
- Kotori will also signal Grafana_ in order to create some instant dashboards
  reflecting the telemetry fields of the measurement data just ingested.

WAN addressing
==============
One of the convention of the `MQTTKit communication flavor`_
is that is uses several MQTT topic segments implementing the
»quadruple hierarchy strategy« in a wide-network addressing
scheme like outlined within the `MQTTKit addressing scheme`_::

    realm / network / gateway / node

Implementation details
======================
The main workhorse is the `DAQ core router`_, which is spun up at
`mqttkit.py, l. 26 <https://github.com/daq-tools/kotori/blob/0.24.5/kotori/daq/application/mqttkit.py#L26-L32>`_,
essentially tying all things together.

The addressing scheme is implemented through the `WanBusStrategy`_ component.
It will take the responsibility of properly receiving and decoding message
payloads arriving on the MQTT bus according to the specific conventions
implemented in there.
